# Variables declared with var (1/3).
    
*Variables declared with __var__ are __hoisted__ to the top.*
    
What does it mean? Hoisting is a JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations
to the top of the current scope. The current scope can be the current script or the current function.
Example:
    
```js
var a = 1;
    
console.log(a);  // 1
```

The variable `a` is declared as global (as expected).

```js
if (a === 1) {
  var b = 2; 
}
    
console.log(b);  // 2
```
    
Variable `b` is inside an `if` block, but in JavaScript it doesn't create a new scope. It's declared as global too.

---
    
# Variables declared with var (2/3).
    
```js
for (var c = 0; c < 3; c++) {
  ...
}
    
console.log(c);  // 3
```
    
The variable `c` is declared in a `for` loop, but it is also lies in the global scope.

```js
function doSomething() {
  var d = 4;
}
    
console.log(d);  // ReferenceError: d is not defined
```
    
The variable `d` is declared in his own scope. It's inside a function and only function creates new scopes.
    
---
    
# Variables declared with var (3/3).
    
Another example of __hoisting__:     
    
```js
function doSomething (name) {
  if (name === 'nico') {
    var awesome = true;
  }
  return awesome;
}
    
doSomething('nico')  // <- true
doSomething('marc')  // <- undefined
```
    
Behind the scenes, the JavaScript engine changes the function to look like this
    
```js
function doSomething (name) {
  var awesome;
  if (name === 'nico') {
    awesome = true;
  }
  return awesome;
}
```

# Let declaration (1/2).
    
The `let` declaration syntax is the same as the syntax for `var`, but it limits the variable's scope to only the current code block.
Previous examples, but with `let`:
    
```js
let a = 1;
 
if (a === 1) {
  let b = 2; 
}
 
for (let c = 0; c < 3; c++) {
  ...
}
 
function doSomething() {
  let d = 4;
}
 
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
console.log(c); // ReferenceError: c is not defined
console.log(d); // ReferenceError: d is not defined
```
    
---
    
# Let declaration (2/2).
 
Quick quiz.

```js
let a = 2;

if (a > 1) {
  let b = a * 3;
  console.log(b);  // 6
    
  for (let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
    let j = i + 10;
    ...
  }

  let c = a + b;
  console.log(c);  // 8
}
```
    
Which variable(s) exist only inside the `if` statement, and which variable(s) exist only inside the `for` loop?
    
--
    
__Answer__: the `if` statement contains `b` and `c` block-scoped variables, and the `for` loop contains `i` and `j` block-scoped variables.
    
---
    
# Let declarations in loops (1/2).
    
```js
var funcs = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  funcs.push(function(){
    console.log(i);
  });
}

funcs[3]();  // 3
```
    
The `let i` in the `for` header redeclares a new `i` for each iteration of the loop.
In other words, on each iteration, the loop creates a new variable `i` and the closures are created inside the loop iteration.
    
The same snippet, but with `var i` in the `for` loop header, would get `5` instead of `3`,
because there would only be one `i` in the outer scope which had the last assigned value `i`.
    
[Fiddle with var](http://www.es6fiddle.net/il1agcx0/)
    
__Note:__ `let` also works the same way with `for..in` and `for..of` loops.
    
---
    
# Let declarations in loops (2/2).
    
Example for `for..in` loop:
    
```js
var funcs = [],
    object = {a: true, b: true, c: true};

for (let key in object) {
  funcs.push(function() {
    console.log(key);
  });
}

funcs.forEach(function(func) {
  func();  // outputs "a", then "b", then "c"
});
```
    
Each time through the loop, a new `key` binding is created, and so each function has its own copy of the `key` variable.
The result is that each function outputs a different value. If `var` were used to declare `key`, all functions would output `c`.

# Const declaration (1/3).
    
`const` declaration creates constants. It is a variable that is read-only after its initial value is set.
    
```js
const a = 2;
console.log(a);  // 2
    
a = 3;  // SyntaxError: "a" is read-only
```
    
Values of variables declared using `const` cannot be changed once set.
For this reason, every `const` variable must be initialized on declaration:
    
```js
// valid constant
const maxItems = 30;
    
// SyntaxError: missing initialization
const name;   
```    
    
---
    
# Const declaration (2/3).

Constants are not a restriction on the value itself, but on the variable's assignment of that value.
In other words, the value is not frozen or immutable because of `const`, just the assignment of it.
If the value is complex, such as an object or array, the contents of the value can still be modified.
Example:
    
```js
const a = [1,2,3];
a.push(4);
console.log(a);  // [1,2,3,4]
    
a = 42;  // SyntaxError
```
    
Constants, like `let` declarations, are block-level declarations.
    
```js
if (condition) {
  const maxItems = 5;
  ...
}

// maxItems isn't accessible here
```
    
---
    
# Const declaration (3/3).
    
Constants, like `let` declarations, throws an error when made with an identifier
for an already-defined variable in the same scope
    
```js
var message = "Hello!";
let age = 25;

// each of these would throw an error.
const message = "Goodbye!";
const age = 30;
```
    
Constans can be used in loops too.
    
```js
// doesn't cause an error due to a new binding on each iteration
for (const key in object) {
  funcs.push(function() {
    console.log(key);
  });
}
```
    
__Attention:__ But the value of `key` cannot be changed inside the loop.
    
---
    
# Redeclaration pitfall.
    
If an identifier has already been defined in a scope, then using the identifier in a `let` declaration
inside that scope causes an error to be thrown.
    
```js
var count = 30;
   
// Syntax error is thrown
// because count is declared twice within the same block
let count = 40;
```

But the next `let` declaration doesn't throw an error.
    
```js
var count = 30;
    
if (condition) {
  let count = 40;
}
```
    
Why? Because it creates a new variable `count` within the `if` statement block,
instead of creating `count` in the surrounding block. Inside the `if` block, this new variable shadows the global `count`,
preventing access to it until execution leaves the block.
    
---
    
# The Temporal Dead Zone (1/2).
    
The `let` and `const` declarations are not hoisted to the top of the enclosing block.
A variable declared with either cannot be accessed before the declaration. Attempting to do so results in a reference error.
    
```js
if (condition) {
  console.log(typeof value);  // ReferenceError!
  let value = "blue";         // TDZ
}
```
    
The line with `let value = "blue"` is never executed because the previous line throws an error.
But the next code snippet works without errors because `typeof` check occurs outside of the block in which `value` is declared.
    
```js    
console.log(typeof value);  // "undefined"   
if (condition) {
   let value = "blue";
}
```

There is no `value` binding ouside of the block, and `typeof` simply returns `undefined`.
    
---
    
# The Temporal Dead Zone (2/2).
    
__Memorize again and notice the difference__:

Accessing a `let`-declared variable earlier than its `let` declaration / initialization
causes an error, whereas with `var` declarations the ordering doesn't matter.
    
```js    
{
  console.log(a);   // undefined
  console.log(b);   // ReferenceError!

  var a;
  let b;
}
```
